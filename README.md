#IGG-Updater

This repository contains a .py file which helps to download and extract the file using Google Drive from IGG-GAMES.COM

How the program works is that you modify the URL to the game that you would like to download.
e.g. https://igg-games.com/among-us-free-download.html

The code is tested to work with Python 3.5.2

Requirements for modules are listed in requirements.txt

NOTE: This does not work with games that are split into different Parts.
e.g. Microsoft Flight Simulator, https://igg-games.com/microsoft-flight-120415897-simulator-2020-free-download.html
It contains 15 parts of files. The .py file only caters to links with WORKING google drive links that DOES NOT EXCEED Download Quotas set by google, or IS NOT removed by Google for abuse and only has a SINGLE PART.
